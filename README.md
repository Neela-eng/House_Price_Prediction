HomePrice.AI
HomePrice.AI is a web-based machine learning application designed to predict house prices based on various property features such as area, number of rooms, furnishing status, and location. The system assists customers, real estate agents, and administrators in making data-driven decisions using predictive analytics.
Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an intelligent real estate price prediction system that:
- Predicts house prices accurately using machine learning techniques
- Provides role-based access for different users
- Visualizes real estate trends
- Supports decision-making in the real estate domain
Features
- User registration and login system
- Role-based dashboards (Customer, Agent, Admin)
- House price prediction using Machine Learning
- Property note management for agents
- Feedback and help request system
- Data visualization using charts
- Secure authentication and session handling
Technologies Used
Backend:
- Python
- Flask Framework
- MySQL Database
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas, NumPy

Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chart.js

Machine Learning:
- Random Forest Regressor
- Feature encoding and preprocessing
- Model serialization using Joblib
How the System Works
1. Users register and log in to the system.
2. Customers enter property details to receive predicted house prices.
3. Agents manage property notes and generate reports.
4. Admins manage users, analyze feedback, and retrain the ML model.
5. The trained machine learning model processes inputs and generates predictions.
Database Details
The application uses a MySQL database with the following tables:
- users
- predictions
- feedback
- help_requests
- notes
Conclusion
HomePrice.AI demonstrates the practical use of machine learning and full-stack web development in the real estate domain. The project combines predictive analytics, visualization, and role-based access control to deliver a real-world application.
